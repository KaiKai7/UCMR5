                    <div class="contaminant-description">In 1949, 3M began producing PFOS-based compounds by electrochemical fluorination resulting in the synthetic precursor perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride. In 1968, organofluorine content was detected in the blood serum of consumers, and in 1976 it was suggested to be perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or a related compound such as PFOS. In 1997, 3M detected PFOS in blood from global blood banks, although the company's internal documents indicate knowledge of this decades earlier, dating from the 1970s. In 1999, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began investigating perfluorinated compounds after receiving data on the global distribution and toxicity of PFOS, the key ingredient in Scotchgard. For these reasons, and USEPA pressure, the primary American producer of PFOS, 3M, announced, in May 2000, the phaseout of the production of PFOS, PFOA, and PFOS-related products. Most other manufacturers (particularly, those in Europe) phased out the production of PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in 2000 and 2006, respectively. A shorter-chain PFOS (perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, PFHxS), was included in Annex A to the Stockholm Convention in 2022. Currently, most of PFOS and PFOS-related chemicals are produced in China.</div>

                    <div class="contaminant-description">Perfluorodecanoic Acid (PFDA) and its related salts are members of the group of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS are not naturally occurring in the environment; they are man-made compounds that have been used widely over the past several decades in consumer products and industrial applications because of their resistance to heat, oil, stains, grease, and water. Concerns about PFDA and other PFAS stem from the resistance of these compounds to hydrolysis, photolysis, and biodegradation, which leads to their persistence in the environment. PFDA has been used in stain and grease-proof coatings on food packaging, furniture, upholstery, and carpet. PFDA has also been detected in nano- and impregnation-sprays, outdoor textiles, carpet, gloves, paper-based food contact materials, ski wax, and leather. Exposure is possible via inhalation of indoor or outdoor air, ingestion of drinking water and food, and dermal contact with PFDA-containing products.</div>

It can also be used more informally to refer to the group of related fluorochemicals that are used to produce GenX. DuPont began the commercial development of GenX in 2009 as a replacement for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, also known as C8). The chemicals are used in products such as food packaging, paints, cleaning products, non-stick coatings, outdoor fabrics and firefighting foam. The chemicals are manufactured by Chemours, a corporate spin-off of DuPont, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. GenX chemicals are used as replacements for PFOA for manufacturing fluoropolymers such as Teflon, the GenX chemicals serve as surfactants and processing aids in the fluoropolymer production process to lower the surface tension allowing the polymer particles to grow larger. The GenX chemicals are then removed from the final polymer by chemical treatment and heating. PFOA and related compounds have been found to be toxic and carcinogenic. However, in lab tests on rats, GenX has been shown to cause many of the same health problems as PFOA.</div>

                    <div class="contaminant-description">Lithium is a naturally occurring element and may be found at higher concentrations in certain parts of the country, particularly in groundwater sources in arid locations in the Western U.S. where geologic formations contain lithium salts. Lithium, in various formulations, has numerous commercial uses including as a pharmaceutical drug, an industrial chemical catalyst, a sanitizing agent for swimming pools and hot tubs, and increasingly, as a component of lithium-ion batteries for electronics and electric vehicles. Lithium is likely present in a variety of foods (such as cereal grains, leafy vegetables, and root crops), but it is not clear which foods may be significant sources of dietary lithium. There are differing perspectives on whether lithium is beneficial in small amounts (e.g., a micronutrient). The U.S. has no current recommended dietary allowance. Lithium salts (e.g., lithium carbonate, lithium citrate) have been used clinically for decades in the U.S. as a mood-stabilizing medication, primarily for bipolar disorder. Therapeutic doses of lithium compounds generally range from 600-1,200 mg/day. Therapeutic doses carry the risk of harmful side effects, so therapy strategies are based on a risk-benefit assessment for individual patients.</div>
